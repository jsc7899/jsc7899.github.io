# About

Hi, I’m Jared, a security engineer, AI enthusiast, builder and fixer of things.

### My day job

My team and I are responsible for the security and risk management of UT. We also work with the entire UT System and other organizations both in and out of Texas. It's a lot of responsibility, but also also a ton of fun. I work with great people on awesome projects like our distributed CHOMP system that scans for vulnerabilities across hundreds of thousands of endpoints each day.

### What drives me

I love building and automating things. From software like automating the maintenance on my homelab to hardware like the environmental control system I built for my terrarium. I also enjoy building things that have nothing to do with computers like the catio I recently built for my two cats.

Health and fitness is also very important to me. To be able to build and learn the knowledge I need to build, I have to be productive with each day, and that all starts with being healthy. My passion for fitness started with powerlifting in high school. I enjoyed it so much that I joined the powerlifting team at UT and even made it to the USPA Nationals my freshman year.

### Personal projects

You might say I've been a bit obsessed with AI lately. It's been absolutely fascinating to watch the progress that's been made in just the last couple years. Most of my current projects have something to do with AI, and it's also inspired me to start writing about it (hence this blog!).

Some of the projects I've been excited about lately are:

- Custom LLM-powered autocomplete for Vim. I've tried a few of the available plugins for autocomplete, but none have quite hit the mark for how I'd like them work. So I finally decided to take all ideas I've had about how llm-based autocomplete should work and start trying to create my own plugin for Neovim in Lua.

- Converting my current 3 node proxmox cluster to a k3s cluster and installing it in a [mini rack](https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/) inspired by Jeff Geerling. Even though it might not seem AI-related, I managed to make it so by using the latest o3 model with search to create a parts list and build plan based on my own specifications, which worked really well!

- Local-LLM powered security cameras. I've tested numerous wired and wireless security cameras over the years, and frankly they all suck. With the recent improvements in multi-modal, locally hosted LLMS, things are just now getting good enough to be able to easily run your own security system of agents, and I've finally found a set of cameras that have decent hardware and a local RTSP stream I can feed into scripts.

- And this here site! I've only just started, but I do have plans to post some of my older writings and projects as well - as soon as everyone stops releasing new LLM models and topping benchmarks on a daily basis! I feel like every time I write something about AI, it's outdated and surpassed by a new advancement before I can even finish editing, but it sure is exciting!
